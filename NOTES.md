# About nestjs

- NestJS is a Node.js back-end development framework built upon Express, leveraging the power of TypeScript.

- NestJS leverages the incredible popularity and robustness of JavaScript as a language and Node.js as a technology. It is inspired by common libraries and frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue which improve developer productivity and experience.

- Even considering the amount of superb libraries, helpers and tools that exist for server-side Node.js, none of them effectively solve the main problem - the architecture of an application.

- NestJS provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications

- Recently, the NestJS framework is gaining extreme popularity due to its incredible features;

- Leverages TypeScript - strongly typed language which is a super-set of JavaScript

- Simple to use, easy to learn and easy to master

- Powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that boosts productivity and ease of development

- Detailed, well-maintained documentation

- Active codebase development and maintenance

- Open-source (MIT license)

- Supports dozens nest-specific modules that help you easily integrate with common technologies and concepts such as TypeORM, Mongoose, GraphQL, Logging, Validation, Caching, Websockets and much more

- Easy of unit-testing applications

- Made for Monoliths and Micro-services (entire section in the documentation regarding the Microservice type of a NestJS application, as well as techniques and recipes).

- In this I am going to guide you through the process of planning, developing and deploying a fully-featured back-end application, based on my experience developing and maintaining systems that support dozens of millions of concurrent users at scale.
